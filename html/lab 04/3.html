    <h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>
    <p>The <i>cottage garden</i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an
        informal design, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental
        and edible plants.</p>
    <p>The Cottage Garden originated in <u>England</u> and its history
        can be traced back for centuries, although they were re-invented
        in 1870's England, when stylized versions were formed as a
        reaction to the more structured and rigorously maintained
        <u>English estate garden</u>.</p>
    <p>The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their
        modern descendents, with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs,
        along with some fruit trees.</p>
