    <h1>From Garden to Plate</h1>
    <p>A potager is a French term for an ornamentel vegetable or
        kitchen garden. Often flowers (edible and non-edible) and
        herbs planted with the vegetables to enhance the garden's
        beauty. The goal is to make the function of providing food
        aesthetically pleasing.</p><br>
    <h1>What to Plant</h1>
    <p>Plants are chosen as much for their functionality as for their
        color and form. Many are trained to grow upward. A well-design
        potager can provide food, cut flowers and herbs for the home
        with very little maintenance. Potagers can disguise their
        function of providing for a home in a wide array of forms-
        from the caretree style of the cottage garden to the
        formatily of a knot garden.</p>
